A global consulting firm has accumulated vast amounts of data on company layoffs across multiple countries. This data spans various sectors, job roles, and regions, reflecting significant changes in the global workforce. However, they lack the in-house expertise to effectively analyze and interpret this data. They need a data analyst to help them uncover critical insights to guide their advisory services.

The firmâ€™s main objectives include:

1. Identifying High-Risk Sectors: Understanding which industries are experiencing the highest rates of layoffs, potentially indicating vulnerability or market shifts. This information could guide their clients on where to focus or diversify investments.

2. Analyzing Layoff Patterns for Global Employment Trends: Examining layoff data to detect employment trends on a global scale, such as rising or declining demand in specific roles, geographies, or skillsets. This would help their clients anticipate hiring needs, reskilling requirements, and workforce transformations.

3. Assessing Economies at Risk: Using layoff data to identify regions or countries where job losses are heavily concentrated, potentially signaling economic instability. Insights from this analysis could help governments, NGOs, and multinational corporations plan interventions or investments to support struggling economies.

4. Detecting Declining Demand for Certain Job Types: Observing trends where certain roles or skillsets are consistently associated with layoffs, such as those susceptible to automation or outsourcing. This analysis could inform reskilling programs, future talent development, and workforce planning strategies for clients.
