The main objective of this project is to use SQL to clean and standardize layoff data
across multiple companies. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values,
correcting data inconsistencies, and formatting the data for accurate analysis. 
By ensuring the dataset is clean, we can produce reliable insights into trends and 
patterns in company layoffs.
